# Getting Started With d3.js

d3.js is an interesting and powerful library for visualizations. One of the structures what I wanted to create with it was a sunburst type Pie Chart.

I found this nice tutorials [tutorial-1](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/e1cdbbe586ac31747b4a304f8f86efa5), [tutorial-2](https://bl.ocks.org/denjn5/f059c1f78f9c39d922b1c208815d18af) by David Richard. I plan to learn how to create a sunburst chart from it and add some few modifications of my own.

# How to run this project
To get started :
* We need a local dev server to host our files, this can be done easily by installing this lovely npm package [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
* Then in the terminal run `http-server` to run the server.
* I use visual studio code to develop this project, and [Debugger For Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension for better js debugging.
